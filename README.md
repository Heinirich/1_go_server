Go is a great language for creating simple yet efficient web servers and web services. It provides a built-in HTTP package that contains utilities for quickly creating a web or file server.

The goal of this tutorial is to create a web server that can accept a GET request and serve a response. We’ll use the server to serve static files, acting as a file server. We’ll then make the web server respond to a POST request coming from a form submission, such as a contact form.
